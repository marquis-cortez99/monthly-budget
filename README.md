
Monthly Budgeting Web Application - TrackBud

“TrackBud is an innovative web application designed to help individuals manage their personal finances with ease and efficiency. The platform offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to track their monthly income, expenses, and savings, all in one place.”

The following are the features of the TrackBud web application.

* Expense Tracking: Users can input their expenses into the application and track them by category (e.g. rent, groceries, entertainment, etc.). The application calculates the total amount spent on each category and provides a visual representation of the data.

* Income Tracking: Users can input their income into the application and track it. The application calculates the total income and displays it on the dashboard.

* Savings Goals: Users can set savings goals and track their progress towards them. The application displays a goal bar that grows as users get closer to their savings goal, allowing the user to celebrate their financial milestones.

* Annual Tracking: When users inputs their monthly bills, an annual amount is formed displaying what a user will spend in a 12 month period. This can help the user calculate how much their monthly bills equal to annually, so they can anticipate their expenses for the entire year.

* Currency Converter API: Allows the user to calculate the amount of money they would have in other currencies.

The following technologies were used to develop the TrackBud web application:
* HTML: Used to create the structure of the web application.
* CSS: Used to style the web application and make it visually appealing.
