Monthly Budgeting Web Application - TrackBud

TrackBud is a monthly budgeting web application developed by our team for our first group project. The application allows users to track their monthly expenses, income, and savings goals. The application calculates the amount of money left over after expenses and the amount spent annually on bills.

Features
The following are the features of the TrackBud web application.

* Expense Tracking: Users can input their expenses into the application and track them by category (e.g. rent, groceries, entertainment, etc.). The application calculates the total amount spent on each category and provides a visual representation of the data.

* Income Tracking: Users can input their income into the application and track it. The application calculates the total income and displays it on the dashboard.

* Savings Goals: Users can set savings goals and track their progress towards them. The application displays a goal bar that grows as users get closer to their savings goal. When users reach certain milestones, an emoji is displayed to motivate them to keep striving towards their goal.

* Annual Tracking: When users inputs their monthly bills, an annual amount is formed displaying what a user will spend in a 12 month period. This can help the user visualize the was their annual cost is and potentially cut down on unimportant expenses.

* Stock Market and Investing: Users are able to view and track current stock prices. Users can use this information to help them make decisions on where to invest their money.
